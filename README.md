# Getting started:
Download the necessary zig compiler required by Mach: [mach verified compilers](https://machengine.org/about/zig-version/). Tested with the `Zig 2024.5.0-mach` compiler, specifically `zig-linux-x86_64-0.13.0-dev.351+64ef45eb0`). After extraction place the entire folder in the project folder and build with `./zigMachCompiler/zig build run`.

## Todo:
- [ ] Use glElementsInstanced and uniform array for the positions
- [ ] Place shader files as seperate files
